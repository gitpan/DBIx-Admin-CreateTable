Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Admin::CreateTable.

2.03  Thu Dec  4 15:54:00 2008
	- Change licence text in preparation for Debian packaging

2.02  Sun Nov 23 10:08:00 2008
	- Add DBI to Build.PL and Makefile.PL since:
		o t/2.syntax.error.t uses it
		o CPAN testers were getting errors
		o Callers must create a $dbh, but this module doesn't actually use DBI
	- Fix typo in Changes.txt on the line 2.01...
	- Generate Changelog.ini as I should have with the last version

2.01  Tue Nov 18 10:34:00 2008
	- Add support for SQLite. Note: My code for SQLite uses 'integer primary key auto_increment'
	  as the definition of the primary key's type. To get the autoincrement part of that to work,
	  you must provide a NULL - i.e. a Perl undef - for your primary key column when inserting a
	  new record into the database

2.00  Sun Nov 16 12:06:00 2008
	- Convert various files from DOS to Unix format
	- Reformat the source of CreateTable.pm, Build.PL and Makefile.PL, a bit
	- Rename the test files (pod.t => 0.pod.t, test.t => 1.test.t)
	- Add t/2.syntax.error.t
	- Only run tests in t/2.syntax.error.t if $DBI_DSN, $DBI_USER and $DBI_PASS are defined
	- Remove eval
	- Localize RaiseError in drop_table(), so as to not error when table does not exist
	- Make create_table return DBI's errstr() on fail or '' on success, so result can be tested
	- Make drop_table return '' on success, so result can be tested (in t/2.syntax.error.t)
	- Remove FindBin::Real from list of required modules

1.04  Thu Aug 23 15:31:00 2007
	- Expand docs even more
	- Rename generate_sequence_name() to generate_primary_sequence_name()

1.03  Wed Aug 15 13:58:00 2007
	- Expand docs per method with tables documenting behaviour per database vendor

1.02  Fri Jun 09 14:54:00 2006
	- Patch sequence handling code to work with Oracle

1.01  Tue May 16 14:09:00 2006
